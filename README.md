Prediction Model
A machine learning model (like Decision Tree) built in Python that predicts whether a patient will miss or attend their appointment based on factors like age, SMS reminder, and waiting days.

File/Output:
Python code (.ipynb or .py)
Sample prediction outputs
Accuracy score

Power BI Insight Dashboard

A visual report in Power BI that shows key insights from your dataset—for example:
Which day of the week has the most no-shows
Are younger or older patients more likely to miss appointments
Does receiving an SMS reduce no-shows?
You’ll use your CSV (with predictions) in Power BI to create:
Bar charts
Pie charts
Line graphs
Slicers (filters like SMS, Age)

Optimization Recommendations
I analysis-based  on how the hospital can reduce missed appointments. These are written points i include in my report or slides.

Examples:

“Sending SMS reminders increases show-up rate by 30%. We recommend SMS to all patients.”
“Avoid scheduling appointments for elderly patients on Mondays, as this day has the highest no-show rate.”
“Shorter waiting periods (0–2 days) lead to higher attendance.”
